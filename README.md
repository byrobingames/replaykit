<span style="color:red;">For Android make sure you selected API 21 or higher in Mobile settings->version->Android Target version</span>

1)Use the Initialize ReplayKit block in your first (loading)scene in “when created” Event.<br/>
Use this block only once a session. If you want to ask the user to view the video or discard the video select YES, else select NO. If No the video will been viewed automatically after stop recording.<br/>

4)EXAMPLE: In the Events tab of the actor add an when the mouse is pressed on Self Event.
- Setup the Actor animation like example below.
- Put the Start Recording block between the if startRecording statement, when startRecording is true then set startRecording to false and switch to animation 1 (stop button) and Start Recoding.
- Put the Stop Recording in the otherwise block, set the startRecording to true again and switch back to animation 0 (start button) and Stop Recording.<br/>

5)EXAMPLE: Create an scene where you want to create the Actor (Start/Stop button). In the Events tab add an when created event.
  - Put the replaykit available block in an if statement and put the create actor between it.<br/>
Because ReplayKit works only on iOS9 or above and Android 5.0 or above and because it is not available on all devices, you only want to show the Recording button on devices where the Replaykit is available.<br/>
If the ReplayKit is not available it will return false and the Actor will never be created.<br/>

6) Test it and play with it. You can share the video when you preview the video. Apple has set an standard share message that cannot be modified.<br/>
Standard message when you testing is:<br/>
<strong>[app store app name] from [developer]<br/>
http://www.apple.com<br/></strong>
This message will be set to your game when you publish you game.<br/>

7)isRecoding block.
This boolean block turns true when recording start and turns to false when recording stops.<br/>
If the ReplayKit is not available it will return false and the Actor will never be created.<br/>
